It's about creating a game on several months, individually. The rules ares available in the "besoin du client" PDF file. The entire project organization is overwhelmed by the general containment and closure of educational institutions as a result of the VIDOC-19 pandemic.


The objectives of the project are to increase our skills in :
* Analysis
* Design
* Coding
* Tests
* Project management

    
Organization :
-
We have 1h30 of supervised work per week, the rest of the work must be done independently.
Just before the summer holidays we have ~~two~~ one week~~s~~ of intensive coding, dedicated to the project.


Theoretical timeline :
-
* Week 12 : Project's start
* Weeks 12-14 : specification development
* Weeks 15-20 : analysis and design phase period
* Weeks 16-26 : implementation period   


Evaluation :
-
* 6 april : provisional requirement specifications and project managment
* 18 mai : analysis and design notebook
* ~~22 juin : 2 pages of personal assessment~~
* 22 juin : final report of the project
* ~~24 juin : oral presentations~~

Installation :
-
* Prerequisite :
	* You must have java and it's JDK intsalled on your machine, and the access paths to the ```java``` and ```javac``` commands in your environment's PATH.

* Installation :
	* Linux :
		* Navigate to the ```Code``` folder and type the following command : ```chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh```
		* That's it ! You can now use the zen.sh utility, and move it around.
		* To display the options : ```./zen.sh -h```
	* Windows :
		* Navigate to the ```Code``` folder and click on the ```install.bat``` file.
		* That's it !  You can now use the zenConsole.bat et zenGUI.bat executables (and move them around) to launch the desired versions.

> Please note that the ```Code``` folder needs to be at the location you want to install the app to (if you move it you will have to reinstall it). You can move the executables around on the computer (as long as they stay on the same hard drive then the installation folder).

NB : The Windows version is a bit buggy (encoding problems) on the Rules page. There wasn't enough time to take care of it.


You can find a UserGuide in the ```Conception``` folder if you need to.
